# <p align="center"> A 'How-To' Guide for Extracting GloBI Data :) </p>

GloBI has a ton of useful data in it and can be used in many different ways. However, it can also be a bit overwhelming with so much data. This page offers some helpful links, hacks, and instructions for how to extract the information available in a useful format.

## Introduction to using GloBI <a name="intro"></a>
Did you know there is a video tutorial on how to use GloBI?\
[A Practical Exploration of Biotic Interaction Data Management and Information Retrieval through TPT and GloBI](https://vimeo.com/546669878) (video)

There are also detailed step-by-step instructions from the [Species Interaction Data Workshop](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction-data-workshop/) on how to extract information from GloBI.

## Pre-compiled Datasets <a name="datasets"></a>
Did you know, GloBI has a number of datasets and files pre-compiled and ready to download?! 
\Here are some precompiled datasets you may find useful:
### TPT data <a name="TPT"></a>
- [List of all data files available](https://zenodo.org/record/5572874/files/README?download=1)
- [.tsv file of some interactions from TPT data](https://zenodo.org/record/5572874/files/indexed_interactions_simple.tsv.gz?download=1)
- [.tsv file of *ALL* interactions from TPT](https://zenodo.org/record/5572874/files/indexed_interactions_full.tsv.gz?download=1) Note: this is LARGE file so it will need to be unzipped/compressed. See below for ways to download un-zipped/compressed file...
- [.tsv file of interactions for each collection in TPT](https://zenodo.org/record/5572874/files/indexed_interactions_by_collection.tsv?download=1)
### SCAN data <a name="SCAN"></a>
- [List of all data files available](https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/globalbioticinteractions/scan/README.txt)
- [.csv file of some interactions from SCAN data](https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/globalbioticinteractions/scan/indexed-interactions-sample.csv)
- [.csv file of *ALL* interactions from SCAN](https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/globalbioticinteractions/scan/indexed-interactions.csv.gz) Note: this is LARGE file so it will need to be unzipped/compressed. See below for ways to download un-zipped/compressed file...
