# A 'How-To' Guide for Extracting GloBI Data üòÉ<span id="top"/>

GloBI has a ton of useful data in it and can be used in many different ways. However, it can also be a bit overwhelming with so much data. This page offers some helpful links, hacks, and instructions for how to extract the information available in a useful format.

## Introduction to using GloBI <span id="intro"/>

Did you know there is a video tutorial on how to use GloBI?\
[A Practical Exploration of Biotic Interaction Data Management and Information Retrieval through TPT and GloBI](https://vimeo.com/546669878) (video)

There are also detailed step-by-step instructions from the [Species Interaction Data Workshop](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction-data-workshop/) on how to extract information from GloBI.

## Pre-compiled Datasets <span id="datasets"/>

Did you know, GloBI has a number of datasets and files pre-compiled and ready to download?! 

Just go to the [GloBI Sources page](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/sources), find a collection or group's dataset you are interested in, and click the "review" button on the left with the green checkmark. Then copy the file you want and paste it into your web browser address box. It will automatically start to download the file üòÉ

Here are some multiple collection precompiled datasets you may find useful:

### Terrestrial Parasite Tracker (TPT) data <span id="TPT"/>
[Terretrial Parasite Tracker](https://parasitetracker.org) ([https://parasitetracker.org](https://parasitetracker.org)) is a NSF-funded project that aims to digitize natural history collection records related to parasites and their vertebrate hosts. 
- [List of all data files available](https://zenodo.org/record/5572874)
- [.tsv file of some interactions from TPT data](https://zenodo.org/record/5572874/files/indexed_interactions_simple.tsv.gz?download=1)
- [.tsv file of *ALL* interactions from TPT](https://zenodo.org/record/5572874/files/indexed_interactions_full.tsv.gz?download=1)\
      *Note: this is LARGE file so it will need to be unzipped/compressed. See below for ways to download un-zipped/compressed file...*
- [.tsv file of interactions for each collection in TPT](https://zenodo.org/record/5572874/files/indexed_interactions_by_collection.tsv?download=1)
- [List of collections in the TPT group on GloBI](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/parasitetracker/)

### SCAN data <span id="SCAN"/>
[Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN)](https://scan-bugs.org) ([https://scan-bugs.org](https://scan-bugs.org)) is "A Data Portal Built to Visualize, Manipulate, and Export Species Occurrences." 
- [List of all data files available](https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/globalbioticinteractions/scan/README.txt)
- [.csv file of some interactions from SCAN data](https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/globalbioticinteractions/scan/indexed-interactions-sample.csv)
- [.csv file of *ALL* interactions from SCAN](https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/globalbioticinteractions/scan/indexed-interactions.csv.gz)\
      *Note: this is LARGE file so it will need to be unzipped/compressed. See below for ways to download un-zipped/compressed file...*

### Big-Bee data  <span id="bigbee"/>
The [Big Bee project](https://big-bee.net/) ([https://big-bee.net/](https://big-bee.net/)) aims to "Extend Anthophila research through image and trait digitization."

## General Searches <span id="searches"/>

### Search from home page <span id="home-search"/>
- Navigate to [GloBI's home page](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/)
- Enter an organism name in one or both search boxes
- Hit search

![](https://i.imgur.com/3nxuq2q.png "")

- You can browse these result in the resulting list, or for a downloadable list, click the ‚ÄúOpen results in interaction browser‚Äù link
- This will bring up a map, two different interactive interaction graphs, and a list of interactions on the left.
 
![](https://i.imgur.com/SxR6atJ.png "")

- To download the list of the interactions, click the ‚Äúdownload csv data sample‚Äù at the top of the list for a partial list, or for a full dataset click "more data access options" and select the file you want.
   - Copy and paste the file name into your browser address box to download, or use the [hack below](#no-download) to view the dataset without downloading

### Search from browse page <span id="browse-search"/>

## Using R <span id="R"/>

For those that are comfortable using R, install and use **rglobi** for more precise and filtered datasets. 
- [rglobi CRAN (download) page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rglobi/index.html)
- [rglobi GitHub installation instructions](https://github.com/ropensci/rglobi)

## GloBI Hacks <span id="hacks"/>

### No-download data viewing <span id="no-download"/>

You can view datasets from GloBI (or any other .csv/.tsv files online) without actually downloading them! This is possible by using Google Sheets and removing the 
".gz" extention of a file from the [GloBI Sources page](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/sources). 
- Open a new blank Google Spreadsheet in one browser tab/window
- In another browser tab/window, pick the dataset you want to view
   - On the [GloBI Sources page](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/sources), pick a collection or group
   - On the left of the items listed, click the "review" button with a green checkmark next to it
   - From the list of files that opens on a new page, copy the file name of the file you want to view (excluding the .gz part if it has it)
- Go back to your blank Google Spreadsheet tab
- In the first cell type the formula:

```
IMPORTDATA("YOUR FILE NAME")
```
   Example: 
```
=IMPORTDATA("https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/globalbioticinteractions/scan/indexed-interactions-sample.tsv")
```
- Don't forget the quotation marks in the formula!
