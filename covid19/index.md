This page includes links, meeting info and timelines of activities related to developing research questions and supporting data products in context of COVID-19. These activities were initiated via [COVID19-TAF - Communities Taking Action](https://cetaf.org/covid19-taf-communities-taking-action), a community-rooted initiative raised jointly by CETAF and DiSSCo.  

The information on this page does not aim to be a complete overview of activities, but rather a minimalist collection of past accomplishments and ongoing activities.
