After months of preparations, about 50 contributors to the NSF-sponsored ( [DBI:1901926](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1901926), [DBI:1901932](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1901932)) Terrestrial Parasite Tracker (TPT, [https://parasitetracker.org](https://parasitetracker.org), [[1](#1)] ) Thematic Collection Network gathered in the [Field Museum](https://fieldmuseum.org) in Chicago, IL for a [2 day workshop on 24-25 February 2020](https://www.idigbio.org/content/terrestrial-parasite-tracker-workshop-best-practices-and-standardization-digital-data). The goals of the TPT workshop were to share ideas on how to best digitize parasitic arthropods specimen and make their associated digital records easily and openly accessible in order to build a better picture of how these little creatures (e.g., ticks, lice, mites) spread disease and parasitize their hosts. The TPT project uses GloBI to find, index and review parasite-host associations captured in openly accessible digital collections shared by [participating institutions](/parasitetracker/#tpt-collections-status).

Physical specimen in natural history collections are often accompanied with handwritten or printed labels (fig. 1). For parasite specimen, these labels often contain valuable information about the environment or organism they were collected from. This information carries clues to what hosts these parasites may associate with. One of my highlights of the workshop was a transcription exercise: workshop participants were put into 8 groups and were tasked to first individually transcribe (fig. 2) enlarged prints of specimen labels using a provided datasheet. Then, each of the groups discussed their transcription results and attempted to reach consensus on how to transcribe each of the provided digitized labels. After that, each of the groups presented their results and discussion followed. The main take-aways from the transcription results and lively discussions were that (a) labels should be transcribed verbatim and (b) interpretation of the verbatim terms should be done by experts using well-defined terms. So, when a label says "pulled from Susan," the transcription should say "pulled from Susan." However, an interpretation of the transcription may say: "associated with: Homo sapiens", or perhaps even "has host: Homo sapiens". The group discussions made it clear that multiple interpretations of a single specimen label may exist. Some of these interpretations, or subjective claims, may even contradict each other.

To help keep track of the digitization efforts, a data paper was published [[2](#2)] and a dedicated TPT web page was created at [https://globalbioticinteractions.org/parasitetracker](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/parasitetracker) (see also [[3](#3)]). The data paper contains a citable snapshot of the project, while the web page contains up-to-date information about TPT affiliated collection and their associated data reviews, indexed interactions and data workflows (i.e., [integration profiles](/parasitetracker/#integration-profiles)). Also, the page contains various examples on how to use [Darwin Core archives to capture biotic association data](/parasitetracker/#dwca-guidelines). In addition, [some pointers to biotic interaction term definitions](/parasitetracker/#supported-terms) are listed on the page  as well as translation tables that details how association terms provided by the collections (e.g.,"on:", "ex:") are interpreted by GloBI.

As the mutualistic partnership between TPT and GloBI matures in the years to come, the TPT affiliated collections and GloBI will co-evolve to improve access to, and use of, physical specimen of vectors and parasites in research, education, policy and management.
