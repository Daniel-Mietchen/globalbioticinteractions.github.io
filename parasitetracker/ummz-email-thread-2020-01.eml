Hi Jorrit, 
Its fine by me to share the email exchanges. 
Thanks again for talking with us earlier and taking notes. I'll try and get the database csv file download and sent to you sometime tomorrow. 
Best,
Erika

    Hey Erika, Barry -

    Do you mind if I attach our email exchange related to the sample records to the meeting notes? I'll make sure to XXX-out the email addresses.

    Our past email exchange holds valuable information for me and shows the intricacies of linking records.

    thx,

I hope that one of the outcome of our meeting is a detailed step-by-step account of the (manual) record linking process that we did over email in the last weeks. With such detailed account, we can get an impression of what is feasible to do within the scope of the Parasite Tracker project and share our ideas with others. I expect that if we provide a detailed record, other TPT colleagues may be inspired to come forward with suggestions and/or try to figure out how make their own host-parasite records easier to find and use.

Unfortunately, we only have the host information that was included on our parasite labels (or cards), or what we can find by doing what you just did and searching data aggregators to see if more info is available. For the FMNH host example that doesn’t quite match up, there could be quite a number of things that went wrong. Maybe the collector accidentally miswrote the host catalog number, or labeled the wrong specimen. Maybe they somehow confused a rodent with a bat (possible as it was collected in guano – I’m not sure how much bat feces looks like rodent feces?). Maybe the collector used the wrong museum acronym. Maybe the record isn’t available online yet and the “-“ in the number matters. The next steps if we wanted to try to find out more would be to ask Barry, since I believe he mounted the parasite specimen in this case (Barry?) and knows way more about the history of our parasite collection in general than I do. And if I didn’t know that Barry often has lots of additional information because he's been working on them for years (or he doesn’t know), I would contact someone in the FMNH Mammals collection to see if they know anything more about the host specimen. Or even if the dash in the catalog number makes it different than what was found online...

Once I get that new relationship field added in, I’ll add it to the mapping scheme (also waiting for IT help to update).

I think there are some in our database that may just have one or the other (it's one field in our database), and I'm pretty sure there may be a few in there that aren't collection specific codes (just a mix of numbers/letters or are outdated collection codes). Those would be harder for me to find specific record examples of though.

I think in our database host ID has often contained common names, but this too is populated when available despite often non-standardized data. We have 5,534 specimens databased so far with hosts that have associated catalog numbers. For example specimen UMMZI- 167581 (which really should have made it onto GBIF by now, but we seem to be having more IPT issues):

I think this provides invaluable additional information – we actually have our technicians double check in VertNet and GBIF when transcribing the label data to see if there is any additional information about the host or taxonomic updates since the slide was made - if there is a catalog number available.  If associatedOccurrences is the easiest way for GloBI to pull the host catalog numbers then I will have it mapped there instead of to dynamicProperties where it would potentially be concatenated with a couple other things like common name or sex.

>>>>>>>>                                 0 – These records are some of our slide mounted flea collection.  Basically all of the fields currently filled in is the parasite’s collection/taxonomic information. For these records the organismRemarks does have some of the host information, but that is just the extra bits/comments that don’t fit in the host taxonomy fields. The host taxonomy fields are not currently mapping to the IPT despite my efforts to change this (more about that below).  The associatedOrganisms field is the host’s catalog number (when we know of one).

>>>>>>>>                                 Unfortunately, our IPT mapping was originally made and launched before the TPT project started. Since the project started we added all additional host taxonomic fields. Even though I have a new mapping scheme that would include these host fields, I believe someone in our museums/IT department has to actually do the implementation/updating part. So far they have been unwilling/able to help update/change this for me (the person who originally helped with the IPT unfortunately quit right before the project started the university hasn’t replaced him yet).
>>>>>>>                                 Great to hear that full host data is available for your mounted flea collection.
>>>>>>>>                                 2 – I have not reached out to other Specify users beyond the email conversation awhile back with you and some of the group. When I finally manage to get someone in our museums/IT department to help me implement the new mapping scheme all the host taxonomy will map to associatedTaxa with other host information mapping to dynamicProperties. I was going to leave the remarks/comments field to continue mapping to organismRemarks, since that should just be extra and GloBI shouldn’t need sort through it.
>>>>>>>                                 In your example, the parasite record contains the host taxonomic information. I am assuming that the Host ID/ Host Catelog No. are populated when host specimen are available. Do you have examples of associating with host specimen records?  Are you thinking of using associatedOccurrences to associate with these host specimen? I think it would be valuable to keep the link to the host record around somehow.
>>>>>>>>                                 3 – Specify can export .csv files and I think some others, although I’ve only used .csv exports so. Its easy to export in general, its just adding all the appropriate fields that are of interest to a query that can be annoying (although you can save the download query of its going to be used multiple times). I think there is also a way to download absolutely everything in the database, but that can take awhile and I’ll have to see if I can remember how to do it.
>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>                                 Do you know how soon the grant requires everything to be fully incorporated into GloBI? While of course I’d like to get things on there sooner rather than later, having things migrate regularly through the IPT would be easiest (once IT updates my mappings). If we have sooner deadlines, then I guess we’ll need to work on downloading and then manually uploading new records/associations (can I/you manually upload a data file to GloBI if necessary?).
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>                                 I am trying to get a sense for the work needed to index parasite-host records in the TPT affiliated collections. In order to avoid any re-work or unexpected surprises, I am trying to get some (even a single record) of data from the collection into GloBI. In your case, would it be an idea to manually create a prototype DarwinCore archive for a couple of records (e.g., one with only host taxonomy, another with host specimen record) to make sure that GloBI can parse the information. Your friendly colleagues at the Field Museum did something similar. Shared Google sheet of occurrences.txt would be suitable: I've created an example at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KEKgypp1pNLGeyqHNf3tiHqz73CbVgdtBCTjBhBlYZQ/edit?usp=sharing .

I am currently trying to get someone here to replace the old mappings with the new ones I have made...

Was the main issue that only a very limited amount of our host data was making it through the IPT to GBIF (and in turn SCAN)? I feel like there was something else I may have need to do to get our collection linked to Globi?
