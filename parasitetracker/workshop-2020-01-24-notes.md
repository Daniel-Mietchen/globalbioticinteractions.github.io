## Attendees
Jen, Katja, Kat, Jorrit
 
## Agenda
0. outline workshop agenda
1. workshop logistics (arrival etc)
2. review workshop timeslot and how to fit with pressing topics
3. GloBI update
4. informatics groups
5. Time commitments + expectations 
6. Strategy on getting providers up-to-speed with data integration (documentation needs?)
 
# Action Items

(Kat) ask active project members (e.g., Erika) to provide 10 or more examples and share with Katja before the end of Jan 2020.  
(Jen) to provide supplies for the group session / need to figure out where / big pieces of post-it notes and sheets / afterwards transcribe this into shared google docs / need to 
(Kat) ask folks to bring laptop
(Katja) Create a google doc reporting template for used terms and translation table to related to more common terms. Same doc can be used to finish afterwards / ensure to capture all the names-emails for break out groups
(Jen) come up with assessment criteria 
(Kat) to reserve some "office hours" time for biotic associations at the workshop
(Kat) ask Matt Yoder for TaxonWorks office hours
(Jen / Katja / Kat ) review GloBI materials - pages and provide suggestions on how to best capture and link biotic association records. 

## Notes
 
Jen - Not everyone is ready to provide data yet. 

Jorrit - there's a clear early adopter vs. getting-up-to-speed folks. 

Katja - no need to involve everyone with nuances of informatics stuff. 

Jen - as we move foward, we need to remember that some folks start at the beginning. 

Jen - after the workshop, we expected folks to be up to speed on how to transcribe data, enter paarasite / hosts taxonomy and use suitable interaction terms. Also, the imaging workflows should be clear. 

Katja - to Jen / Kat - are you developing imaging protocols? 

Jen - we do it for Field Museum and MPM . Hoping to re-use the protocol for other platforms. 

Katja - For symbiota we'll have a working copy on how to enter data. More targeting feature development, instead of end user. 

Jen - we need to have a discussion about the vocabulary around species interation terms. Need to talk about interpretations. 

Katja - for Symbiota, there'll be pre-populated list of species interactions in the User Interface (e.g., a drop-down). The terms use can be shared across platforms. 

Jen - during workshop, I'd like to create a list that shows across the different platforms where the interaction terms live and compare them. 

Jen - University of Minnesota has a ton of image data. They need to segment the data and their Specify instance need to be setup to capture association data. 

Jorrit - Erika Tucker and Barry Oconner have an existing host association data entry. 

Jen/ Kat - Erika will present on Specify biotic associations data entry.  

Jen - Kate Webbink et al. will present on similar topic re: EMu. 

Jen - there will be "new" folks at the meeting, so we need to re-introduce the pieces of Terrestrial Parasite Tracker data. 

Katja - there's a impression there's a way to share biotic interactions. Need to reach out to folks that need guidance. 

Jen - we need to develop resources so that folks will feel comfortable getting started with biotic interactions.

Jen - (re-iterating) need to have a discussion around assocation terms. 

Katja - ensure that we capture verbatim information related to biotic assocations. Make a clear distinction between the verbatim data and the interpretation of the biotic assocations.

Jen - outline of workshop  What date? Day 1 - (after lunch / 1p30 - 4p30 ~3 hours)

    (1) (10-15 mins) Jorrit to re-introduce to GloBI / setup the data cycle and Katja goes into detail / highlight how github is used to https://globalbioticinteractions.org/parasitetracker ~ communications / feedback . 

    (2) (10-15 mins) Katja to outline the association transcription process (target: digitization people and end-users) show steps from data-entry to data search / use / Why it matters what the providers put in? What are the benefits of aligning biotic association terminology? Skeletal translation table to connect verbatim terms to a shared association terminology, do 1 example as a group, the rest on their own

    --- 10 mins break --- 

    (3) (15-20 mins) break into group  (platform agnostic) and ask people to come up with their own list, pick 10 representative examples (pictures of the slide labels)

    (4) (20 mins) each group presents their results

    (5) (20-30 mins) cluster shared terms into similar groups --> commonly shared terms

    (6) (30 mins) back in groups and document translation tables in shared google docs

    --- 10 mins break ---

    (7) (30 mins) discussion / release energy 

    (8) (Katja? Jorrit? 10 mins) final msg/ presentation - take-away - lists of terms + list of similar groups of terms / last big point of contact for the group / summarize the nature of concerns / schedule office hours or one-on-one chats / follow-up check-in month later? 

    (9) (Jen 5 mins) set expectation / annource check-in meeting to assess where folks are / accountability


Jen - there are back-up plans (parachute topics, macropod labs, office hours) available in case we finish early.  
Jen - propose to meet again for coordinate workshop in two weeks  (Wed) 5 Feb 2020 @ 09:00 PST / 11:00 CET 
Jorrit - I can make myself available for initial informatics weekly meetings before the workshop.
Katja - reporting and taxonomy in GloBI / I expect that folks wanting to see what is happening to their data from GloBI / re: taxonomy ~ as the taxonomy is being updated and managed how to resolve multiple taxonomies. 
Kat - TaxonWorks will be used to manage the TPT taxonomy and GloBI is expected to use that taxonomy to provide a TPT view on GloBI data.
